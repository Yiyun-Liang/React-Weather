# [React-Weather](http://damp-mountain-57487.herokuapp.com/#/)
A weather app that uses React routers, Babel, and some ES6 features.

# Notes
- to run the app: ```webpack-dev-server```, and then go to http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/

> > “The dev server uses Webpack’s watch mode. It also prevents webpack from emitting the resulting files to disk. Instead it keeps and serves the resulting files from memory.” — This means that you will not see the webpack-dev-server build in bundle.js, to see and run the build, you must still run the webpack command.

- to run a single JavaScript file, say for practicing coding or algorithms, simply type ```node <filename>``` in the terminal.
